              All high quality gazebos at House of Tents have a high UV resistance - ideal for hot summer days. If UV protection 30+ is enough for you, then the Rendezvous and Sunset steel garden gazebos are just right. If you would like increased protection against UV radiation, then we recommend either our PE marquees, our garden gazebos in the Premium and Deluxe lines, or our Economy steel and Economy aluminium pop up gazebos. All these gazebo tents offer great UV protection of SPF 50+. For the ultimate in sun protection all of our high quality PVC (Profi-line) marquees, as well as the Premium steel and Professional aluminium pop up gazebos offer UV protection of SPF 80+.

            <div class="grid-text__content">
              All gazebos at House of Tents are 100% waterproof. But especially in winter, a season with a lot of wind and heavy rain, the gazebo frame makes all the difference. For example, heavy duty gazebos are more weatherproof than wooden frames. Wooden gazebos are also waterproof, but over time, the wood can rot and splinter. Steel gazebos on the other hand, are very weather-resistant while aluminium gazebos provide the best protection from rust.<br/>
              For garden gazebos that will be standing in one place over winter, we advise choosing a model with a hardtop, as the heavy duty polycarbonate panels can stand up to the worst weather conditions. Depending on the model, they can even withstand snow loads of 50 to 80 kg/mÂ².

To ensure that your product also stands up to strong winds, you will find accessories to increase its stability in our shop. Equip your marquee with a base frame, for example.
